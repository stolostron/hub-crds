# MultiClusterHub CRDs

Central location for CRDs used by Multiclusterhub components. This repo provides CRDs for the [multiclusterhub-operator installer](https://github.com/stolostron/multiclusterhub-operator). Updating CRDs in this repo will trigger an update in the installer repo to point to the latest version.
